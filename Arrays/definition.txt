Arrays

An array is a collection of elements of the same data type, stored in continous memory locations, and accessed using an index.

Syntax:
int arr[5] = {5,10,15,20,25};

Note:
 - Indexing starts from 0
 - Stored in a single block of memory
 - Allows any element to be accessed using the index
 - Once a static array is declared, its size is fixed
 - Can be 1D, 2D or multidimensional
