# Data Structures and Algorithms

---

## Basic Data Structures
### Arrays
* Insertion, Deletion, Searching, Sorting
* Problems: Reverse array, Rotate array, Find duplicates

### Linked List
* Singly, Doubly, and Circular linked lists
* Operations: insert, delete, reverse, find middle, detect loop

### Stack
* Using arrays and linked list
* Problems: Parentheses checker, postfix evaluation

### Queue
* Simple queue, Circular queue, Priority queue, Deque

---

## Non-linear Data Structures
### Trees
* Binary Tree: traversal (inorder, preorder, postorder)
* Binary Search Tree: insert, delete, search
* Problems: height of tree, count nodes, check balanced

### Heaps
* Min heap, Max heap
* Heapify, extract min/max, insert element

### Graphs
* Representation: adjacency list/matrix
* Traversal: BFS, DFS
* Concepts: shortest path (Dijkstra), topological sort

## Algorithms

### Sorting
* Bubble, Selection, Insertion
* Merge Sort, Quick Sort, Heap Sort

### Searching
* Linear Search, Binary Search, Recursive Binary Search

### Recursion & Backtracking
* Factorial, Tower of Hanoi, N-Queens, Sudoku Solver

### Dynamic Programming (DP)
* Fibonacci, Knapsack, Longest Common Subsequence

### Greedy Algorithms
* Activity selection, Huffman coding
